# Tuple
- Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
- In Python tuples are written with round brackets.
- Tuple is used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Tuple are immutable i.e we cannot change the values of tuple once it is created.
- Tuple are the same as list but the only difference is that tuple are immutable whereas list are mutable.

###  Example 

```py

tup = (12,39,46,49,52,21)

print(tup)
# This is use to print the tup values 
tup.index()
# tup.index() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified value.


```
